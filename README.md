## Questions/concerns
I had a hard time trying to visualize what I was trying to acomplish with this homework, when things seemed to be working a couple lines of code knocked it out of sorts. Trying to debug code without commiting changes that would break other parts of the code along with trying to add properly working code was a challenge. Currently working on trying to make my code more DRY as some lines do not work properly. I was getting a node_modules error, which ended up with an unknown error constantly being refered to in the  index files which caused the database to not be rendered at all. Any feedback into how I could make this a working application would be greatly appreciated. I was hoping the controllers would work but that also seems like something that is a bit buggy at the moment. The models I believe are set up right along with the server.js file.
